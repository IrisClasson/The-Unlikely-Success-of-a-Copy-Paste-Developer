# The Unlikely Success of a Copy-Paste Developer  
### Chapter 6  
  
David clicked and clacked his way to the elevator hoping to close the door without Frank as company. He failed.  
Frank joined him and immediately eyed him up and down, and for a second or two stared at David’s crotch. “Do you wear the bike clothes everywhere, ball-pad included? Just to bike around the corner to the food court? Can your balls breathe in that?” He nodded towards David’s crotch, a moose knuckle on display, and straightened his checkered flannel shirt and readjusted his grey ponytail.  
David glanced at the ponytail in the elevator mirror, a silvery snake down Franks back. It’s a well-known fact you must have at least one guy with a ponytail if you have Linux servers and in-house IT support. Frank was that guy.  
David wiped his forehead, thrust his hips confidently, and pointed with both hands, finger guns ready, “What can I say Frank, it’s pretty comfortable, you should try it.”  
“Doesn’t look like it. I mean, is that sweat or tears? Your balls are trying to escape, crying for help!” The elevator stopped at a floor, but nobody was there. Frank groaned and pushed the button to close the doors. “What did you eat anyway, didn’t see you at the Fish and Chips?”  
“Sushi.” Ominous reply.  
“Again?” Frank grimaced and stepped out of the elevator. “You have got to stop eating that shit. Not good for you, David.”  
“If anything, Frank, it’s the coffee you make that would give anybody the shits within minutes.”  
“Doubt anything would be able to strain through your 80’s Lycra wrap.” Quick response.  
“I look good though, don’t I?” David winked and exhaled and held his breath as he bent down to undo his bike shoes replacing them with his slippers. James and a few more colleagues came out of the other elevator, takeaway in their hand. “Hi David, meeting time?”  
David eyed their matching Birkenstocks, “No outdoor shoes indoor.” He said matter-of-factly.  
“They’re indoor shoes. Bircks!” They gestured while pointing at their brown sandals.  
“Fancy cork with leather straps, I see. But you are wearing them to the food court, outdoors… that makes them outdoor shoes.” David replied with a slight raise of the eyebrow.  
“Yeah, but it’s indoor shoes worn outdoor, not outdoor shoes worn indoor.” Trying to plead the case with confusion.  
“And the difference is…?”  
Leo walked by having overheard the entire conversation, “Arguing about shoes again, are we? Let’s go, the conference room with aircon is free. I’m dying. I’d like to have this meeting before my funeral.”  
They were back in the conference room they had used earlier. The fan had been humming all day. David connected his laptop to the projector with a combination of adapters that fanned out from his one port, glitching occasionally.  
“Alright,” David cleared his throat and clicked his pen a few times, “refinement time. And honestly there is only one thing I care about today as Scrum Master and Product Owner, and that is WHEN we will have the performance problem fixed for the shop.”  
“You are a Scrum Master now? Weren’t you project leader last meeting?” Leo chuckled James let out a singular laugh before returning to his salad.  
“I have many roles. This is one of them.” Clever grin on his face.  
“When did you become Scrum Master?” Leo retorted.  
James put his food aside and leaned in with a big grin, “after the conference. You know, the one with the workshop?”  
“Let’s do the refinement…” David hastily replied, with a sudden damp forehead, beads forming like cheap necklaces decorating a slippery piece of skin.  
“…oh noes, I want to refine this.” Leo interrupted.  
  
David had attended a conference a few weeks ago, an Agile conference.  
You might not know but being Agile is a must for software developer companies. You don’t have to be Agile, claiming that you are is good enough. It’s like the participation trophies you get as a kid, or golden stars for doing shit you should do without golden stars, it’s just something you must do to be considered a good boy. Or girl. We don’t collect golden stars, instead we collect fancy words and abbreviations, and those can be traded in for real currency. Extra valuable if you are a consultant because you only trade with make-believe words when getting hired for a project.  
David, although a limber and athletic cycling enthusiast in his late thirties, was not Agile. He was the opposite of Agile. A Waterfall master in fact. And his Un-Agile self had not attended many conferences as he preferred different types of networking events where there was less focus on attending sessions and workshops and more focus on fancy dinners and parties. However, the conference had an XP workshop and since they had to maintain several systems hosted with Windows XP he thought that would be very useful and they could sell in more hours with that expertise.  
Microsoft officially stopped supporting the operating system in 2014, but it didn’t stop him from loving XP and refusing to give up while pushing clients to upgrade. True love can never be forgotten. For the few clients that were using XP, the help from him had been immensely valuable, as no other consultancy firms wanted to guarantee an unsupported operating system version. He had been extraordinarily thrilled about the workshop and immediately booked tickets, hotel, and travel to Norway and made sure everybody at the company knew he would become an expert. However, the workshop didn’t go as intended. As always, he had made several assumptions and couldn’t be bothered with details showing up on that Monday in his best suit ready to rock. The workshop on the other hand, was not about Windows XP. As you’d expect, an Agile conference, offered workshops on Agile methodologies, and XP was one of those, Extreme Programming.  
Too embarrassed to return home early, he wandered mournfully around for the three days the conference lasted, occasionally eating extremely expensive Norwegian food (the Vikings seemed to know how to pillage modern time foreigners) and attended one session on the topic of Scrum. When he came back home, met by colleagues wanting to know the details of his XP adventures, he couldn’t handle the embarrassment and somehow put together a story about him going there to become a Scrum Master. He spent a day searching online and reading, Scrum for Dummies, to get a general idea and at the end of that day he felt confident in his new role, courtesy of Dunning Kruger.  
  
James leaned back “… and that is the story. You really should join us for lunch Leo, you are missing out on the office gossip. David, I believe in you - scrum away!”  
David excused himself and went to get coffee and when he returned everybody seemed ready to­­­ get started with the refinement. Or backlog grooming as they sometimes called it. Truthfully, the grooming would be more akin to putting lipstick on a pig. The word _grooming_ had gone out of fashion in 2013 due to its connotations with child exploitation, but David was happy to exploit developers and therefore found the word fitting. David groomed, James and Leo refined. HR was very unhappy with the former.  
David sat down and stared at the computer. The screensaver had been changed to the Windows XP logo, and James and Leo were giggling like drunk teenagers in the park. He sighed, “You people are so immature.”  
“Alright Master of the Scrums, tell us what to do!” James bowed. _Scrotums,_ Leo thought and hid behind a slight smile. David glared at James and James rubbed his neck timidly, “Too much?”  
“Never, James. You can call me Master any time you like. But let’s get to work. I want an estimate for the PetSockShop delivery, the last item is the performance problems. When? I need a deadline.” All business in his tone.  
Leo exhaled slowly and looked out the window, “How long is a string?”  
“String? I need an estimate. Give me a number. Not a string. Integer. Don’t forget to include time for support.”  
“No floats I assume then,” James winked at Leo.  
“He said estimate, not accurate estimate. Floats are fine,” Leo replied without emotion.  
James paused. “Honestly, I don’t know. Besides, I thought we weren’t doing deadlines- or ‘_estimates’_ as you call them. You know, scrum and all. The best we can do is a guestimate,” James replied, “and that depends on how we fix it. Sorry.”  
“Obviously,” Leo wasn’t sorry and therefore continued, “if James gets to decide, then we’ll rewrite this until we retire and the robots take over, using a plethora of hipster libraries he heard about at a user group. It’ll be the most performant webshop in the world, but we’ll deploy on our deathbed. And equally, I’m not doing support, obviously.” Nailing that one home.  
“I don’t care how it gets fixed, just get it done. And give me an estimate. Or guestimate. Whatever you want to call it. Leo, unless you are an architect, you will do support.” David added not missing a beat.  
Leo swallowed dry air, “Nope. No support for me. No chance.” Leo added before David could reply, ”And the estimate? I don’t know. And If I don’t know, James certainly doesn’t know.”  
“Can you do a walk to measure?” David threw out a hand, “here?”  
“Ah, David. Sorry. It’s a great idea, a fantastic idea. But this room isn’t big enough!” James pressed his lips together into a tight smile and slowly shook his head.  
“Can’t we go back to T-shirt sizes? Do we have to make up a new estimate scale each time? Sort of defeats the purpose.” Leo added.  
“Leo is right, David. HR doesn’t have to know.” James stated.  
“Look, I’m not being accused of body-shaming again. And if we add all the extended sizes HR required…” David air quoted “…for inclusiveness, the scale won’t make sense anymore.”  
“That’s a great point David, good thinking. Let’s do the walk before HR finds another problem with our scales.” James peeked out the hallway, came back, and moved the aircon out of the way.  
Leo stood up, lips pressed firmly against each other, and looked down the hallway, “If this is the initial story, which was creating the whole darn shop…” Leo walked two steps and pointed at James bare feet followed by a gesture towards the end of the hallway, “…then I might as well go to the end of the hallway and use the bathroom there.” Leo started walking accompanied by a muffled shuffling sound from the jeans that were slightly too big on the lean frame and gestured for James to follow. James smiled big and with small, quick steps, caught up.  
“For real? I…” David looked at his phone. A slightly paler David frowned and looked away. “…God damn it.” He closed the email app.  
_Subject: Papers. Sender: Sarah._  
“You alright David?” James waved slowly.  
“No. But I’ll be once I get an estimate. Let’s blow their minds. Can we do that?”  
”I don’t want to blow anything,” James chuckled.  
Leo caught David’s eyes. He looked away, the light reflecting in what resembled a tear. _Fuck it, he needs this_. Leo walked a few more steps down the hallway, hesitated, but stopped nonetheless. “I can fix this.” Leo shouted back. James looked wide-eyed at the black hole at the end of the hallway and threw out his hands. “Really, Leo? You got a magic programmer in China ready to fix this for us?” He was referring to a programmer that had hired a programmer in China to do his work for years and nobody ever noticed because he had done such a good job. They had discussed at length how awesome that would be, jokingly of course. But secretly had researched whether that would be doable.  
David pumped his fist in the air. “That’s what I’m talking about! Hope you are not pulling my leg - this would be splendid.” He measured the length by counting steps. “3 meters, assuming a 90 cm stride.”  
“…not with your legs,” Leo drawled back.  
“Ignore Leo, David, your legs are great! All that biking is paying off!” James offered a thumbs up. Leo’s eyes did a roll.  
“If Leo says it can be done, it will be done!”  
“And assuming a week per meter and multiplying by Pi like you always do James, that gives us…” his voice faded as he pulled up his phone and found the calculator shortcut, “…something between 2 and 2.5 months.” He was all smiles. “Let’s go with 1.5 months. We have a deadline!”  
“I don’t remember giving an estimate, nor do I remember giving a deadline,” Leo looked intensely at David, but he avoided eye contact and walked back to the room.  
“I’ll let the client know!” David shouted as his shadow followed him as mantel into his cave. The supervillain had left the measure. The heroes moaned defeated.  
“Sneaky bastard,” Leo murmured and glared. Leo’s favorite thumb got a nervous bite. It was rough and dry where Leo had nibbled on the skin.  
James slapped Leo’s back as he walked by, “this is going to be a lot of fun! I LOVE profiling. Performance is fun!”  
“Can you be less enthusiastic, James? Please! We are consultants, we don’t do enthusiasm, nor do we do fun.” Leo recoiled trying to avoid the enthusiast.  
“Nope, never!” He spun around loosely, almost floating, with a big grin as he disappeared around the corner.  
  
_2,147,483,647, Leo thought, that’s how long a string is.
